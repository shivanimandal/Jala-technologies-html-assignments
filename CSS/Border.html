<p> The lotus flower is one of the most ancient and deepest symbols of our planet. 
The lotus flower grows in muddy water and rises above the surface to bloom with remarkable beauty. 
At night the flower closes and sinks underwater, at dawn it rises and opens again. 
Untouched by the impurity, lotus symbolizes the purity of heart and mind. 
The lotus flower represents long life, health, honor and good luck.</p>
