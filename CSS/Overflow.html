<h2>CSS Overflow</h2>
<p>The overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.</p>
<p> Setting the value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. 
Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it)</p>

CSS Solved a Big Problem
<br>
<br>

HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!<br><br>

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:<br><br>

<h1>This is a heading</h1><br><br>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p><br><br>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers.<br>
Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.<br><br>

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.<br>

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!<br>
