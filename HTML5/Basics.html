<i> <h2 id = "sectionA"> Who is Mark Zuckerberg? </h2> </i>
<p> Mark Zuckerberg co-founded <b> the social-networking website Facebook </b> out of his college dorm room at Harvard University. 
Zuckerberg left college after his sophomore year to concentrate on the site, the user base of which has grown to more than two billion people, 
making Zuckerberg a billionaire many times over. 
<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">The birth of Facebook was portrayed in the 2010 film The Social Network.</span></p>

<hr>

<i> <h2 id = "sectionB"> Early Life </h2> </i>
<p> Zuckerberg was born on <b> May 14, 1984 </b>, in White Plains, New York, into a comfortable, well-educated family. 
He was raised in the nearby village of Dobbs Ferry. His parents are Karen (née Kempner), a psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist.
Zuckerberg developed an interest in computers at an early age; when he was about 12, he used Atari BASIC to create a messaging program he named "Zucknet." 
His father used the program in his dental office, so that the receptionist could inform him of a new patient without yelling across the room. 
The family also used Zucknet to communicate within the house.</p>

<hr>

<i> <h2 id = "sectionC"> Personal Life </h2> </i>
<p> Zuckerberg has been married to <span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold"> Priscilla Chan</span>, a Chinese-American medical student he met at Harvard, since 2012. 
The longtime couple tied the knot one day after Facebook’s IPO. 
Zuckerberg has two daughters, Max, born on November 30, 2015, and August, born on August 28, 2017.</p>
